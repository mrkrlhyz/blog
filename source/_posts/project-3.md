because I lost my blog post earlier today due to shitty tumblr having no autosave/recovery feature, I decided that Iâ€™ll make a Chrome extension that does that work for me.

ideas so far (will just copy-paste/semi-modify what i sent to miah earlier)

*   write the post on another platform (e.g. gdocs) tapos run a script that posts the text to tumblr
*   type shit on tumblr and autosaves the shit

*   orrr create a blank page that autosaves text, and you can post <!-- more --> it to different blogging platforms in a single click

basically

1. Autosave text
2. Confirmation when closing page
