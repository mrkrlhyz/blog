let's take a short break from playing stardew valley for hours on end, now, and take a little trip.

you see, i have this sort of recurring memory that triggers a mild anxiety, nervousness, fear, or something similar. i have no idea what it means or where it came from or what gives, even, but it involves a screaming voice; a voice yelling at me and it resonates through my ears, and it's frightening. it sends my body shaking, but imperceptibly. my gut tells me it comes from my childhood, and i <!-- more --> can only guess it's my mother's voice shouting at me, reprimanding me for something wrong i did. it is very quiet, nothing i hear in the background; and the voice echoes into the void.

for some reason it comes back to me every now and then — in a dream or mid-thought — although quite rarely, but i can always recognize it the same. it's always unsettling whenever i start "hearing" it in my head, because i can't quite shake it off easily. everytime it comes back to me, i have this urge to find out its source, prompting the voice (or scene, whatever it is) to replay over and over. and it's always the same picture, too — i see myself, a little girl, cowering at my mother's angry yells. and i can never tell if it's an actual memory, or a "memory" that my mind makes up to fit the narrative—that is, what my gut is telling me. it's an endless loop. 

i have been having thoughts of getting myself checked with a psychologist or a shrink (not sure which i should go to) to ask about my behavior in a harassment situation vs. outside of. i can never *ever* seem to apply what i imagine myself doing in such a situation (whether i'm in it or not, but outside of it most often). then again, it's only ever happened to me twice. (well, there are past instances, but the thoughts never occurred to me back then, i guess.) i do remember flashing a finger to a truck driver who catcalled me, and i think that was the first and last time i'll ever retaliate to that kind of scenario.

the other thing [i want to get checked up on] is the subject of this post. i'd just really like to ask for advice what this could be, and how come it doesn't get triggered as often even though my mom screams at me often. i do have a lot of questions, really. my short attention span included, and if it has existed a priori or have onset late so i've only been noticing it now.

anyway, that is all. i want to get back to playing zzz
