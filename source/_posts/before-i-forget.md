sup, tumblr. good.....morning, apparently.

I’m stuck cramming my stupid MP and now I feel like posting something. (Not _entirely_mad at you anymore for trashing the block of text I typed earlier, but I still gotta do something about that.) It’s 2 fucking 30 and I really need to sleep, but I just think this one’s worth writing about....before I forget.

Jeez, it’s really disturbing that I’m making a big deal out of this. I’m starting to think I probably _liked_ it. Ugh. Ew.

Anyway, last night <!-- more --> I dreamt that _Sir E/d/ga/r_ was my suitor? landi? whatever. He was following me around, as if he was my boyfriend? Some weird shit like that. And that we were at a gig together....holy shit. So disturbing thinking about it, but also....satisfying? _what’s the word for it jeezus_ I don’t understand, really. It’s probably funny to me, because I have this stupid big head that thinks some people take interest in me. Hahahaha. Got into my dreams, prolly. How stupid. lol

well, that’s it. I need to fucking sleep. I hope I don’t dream of my other profs, jeez.
