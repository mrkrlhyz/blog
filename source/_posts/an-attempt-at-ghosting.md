*~~Listen: I just thought you ought to hear a piece of me before I distance myself from you for good. I think it goes without saying that you've become quite attached to me. Your messages have started to sound demanding and entitled and it pisses me off. I don't owe you anything. The attention you shower me has been becoming too much for me to handle. Frankly, the poem you sent me last night was the last straw. That pissed me off so badly, I had to get rid of the~~* <!-- more --> *~~app. You wanted to lighten up my mood but you decide to bring up about me getting harrassed with unsolicited dick pics? Wow, gee thanks, I definitely needed to be reminded of that. Plus you really can't get a hint when I'm pissed or want to be left alone. I hate having to spell that out for anyone. And this "kuya" thing...just ticks me off. It's dumb that you act like this older brother but sends me suggestive/sexual remarks every now and then. You're just using my complex against me. And that doesn't make you any different from the other dudes from Reddit who messaged me before.~~*

*~~Don't think that I never enjoyed our conversations -- ngl there were some good ones. I appreciate having someone to talk to about whatever in times of immense boredom. It's just that you've come too close for comfort. I've been keeping you behind this bounding line which you happen to constantly step over, and you've just overstepped it for me to just ignore it. I may be partly at fault for being vague, and for that I apologize. Regardless, I'll be staying away from this app for now. It's been taking too much of my time and energy. I don't want this shit to bother you so I typed this entire thing out. Who knows if you probably saw this coming. Anyway; don't worry about me, I'll be fine, etcetera, etcetera... and you don't really have to reply to this wall of shit text.~~*

been hesitant to send this big wall of text. maybe it's easier for me not to provide any context. he can choke it up. like i said, i don't owe him anything.
