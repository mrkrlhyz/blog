am I still exaggerating at this point?
asking for too much?
asking _too_ much?
second guessing myself again.


relationship update: i've been clueless about him; this has been going on for about a month now.
i have no single idea what's up with him. what's new? what's going on in your life ~~that apparently i don't have _access_ to~~?

~~man, i have no words for this. i've yet to build trust in _this thing_.~~

we have been significantly talking and seeing each other less the past couple of weeks. and i ___fucking___ understand that you're "busy", but-- for <!-- more --> real? sparing me 10 seconds of your life is too much for you now? just to say hi, good morning/night, is too much now? or that my package has arrived? 

_am i asking for too much now?_

i'm in disbelief and i keep asking myself if i'm being overly dramatic over our loss of constant communication. i am in disbelief in the landslide downtrend of our relationship. you feel so distant now. it seems like i don't matter to you unless i'm physically present in front of you. i have been badly wanting to disappear from your life just to see if you'll even try to seek me if i did, even though i pretty much know the answer. don't you want to know how i'm doing? if i'm okay? how'd my day go? no? yeah, i know you're probably not interested in how my day goes. i always just start talking too much and take too much of your precious time. 

___my fucking god i don't fucking deserve this. i don't deserve to always second-guess, or convince myself every fucking time if i still matter to someone.___ have i been such a bad person that i always end up being just, nothing?

and of course i'm always dumb enough to believe that you love me when i ask you while you're half-asleep. and how concerned and "cuddly" you always seem when i arrive to your place. it's fucking ridiculous. it's like you're fucking toying with me at this point, because in some way you're convenienced when i'm around right? someone to help you around the house, someone you can ask to do errands for you when you're incapacitated, someone to be _physically_ around so you don't feel entirely alone. it all boils down to how you "fell in love" with me: you were depressed and lonely. you always wanted me to be with you. but now that you're okay, that's not the case anymore.

## "unfinished" post. 
fuck me for trailing off and getting distracted mid-post. but i believe i've said what i needed to say. i feel worthless, insignificant, ___used___. i'm getting tired of being in this cycle: always questioning myself of my worth based on how an important person treats me. it has been emotionally taxing; ever since you asked for alone time, i've been always trying to pretend i don't give a shit, showing that i'm cool with it, but the same time showing that i'm not okay; i'm dropping hints like fucking bombs, but all that is fucking nothing to you. because like you said, nothing fucking matters. and sure enough, i fall under that category. 

not to mention you always treat me like a child who knows nothing. not only is it belittling me but it's also really fucking insulting. you seem to see me as an inferior, and you always talk to me in a condescending tone when i try to ask or engage in discourse. 

*jeez, why are you messaging me?* you're just fucking wasting your time. 

we're fucking wasting our time.

why don't you just break up with me already?
~~<small>bitch, how about you ask yourself that.</small>~~
