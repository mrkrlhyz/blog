drenched socks in my boots.
breaking down in public bathroom stalls.
sticking a knife into a harasser.
a loneliness searching for isolation.
band-aid solutions.
deteriorating relationships.
decaying emotions.
downtrends in concern with respect to time.
a longing for undivided attention.
a day in the life.
eating out of bounds.
alone with or without you.
crawling into dark holes.
crawling into your arms.

restraining myself from backreading.

~~i miss the old us so much it hurts.~~
