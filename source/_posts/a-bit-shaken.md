I don't think I've said anything on this blog yet since it's fairly recent news but, yeah. I'm part of a startup now.

Well, it's my boyfriend's startup. Not sure if it was made on a whim (probably not, probably yeah), but it was an abrupt and sudden event being part of it.
It was like, hey, you're part of a mini company now, whose product you will know as we go.

Yeah, I know right.

It was all sudden. I've always wanted to work on a startup, but not at this point where I <!-- more --> wanted to focus most on my thesis. I lose everything if I fail this. I need to graduate within the year. The pressure is intense and a startup is not what I need at this point; but here I am anyway. I would say I was *forced* into this, but hey, I agreed. Is it coercion? *Partly yes.* I feel ashamed to decline but at the same time I do really want to be a part of this team. I've *always* wanted to work with him. And now I am. 

It's just that the worktime is rapid and pressured because of Startup School. It's a ten-week program and I believe we have to catch up to something (just learned this today, jeezus) else we get removed from the group or something. Crazy. He's the only one working on the startup full-time. I would really recommend him getting another someone else to work with him (but who knows if he's already done that.) 

Like previously mentioned, this was all so abrupt; unexpected. I still haven't find my place in the startup and can't seem to claim it as my own yet as of now. I always refer to it as *__his__ startup* even though I'm technically a part of it. Haven't talked to the other guy as well so I'm honestly not feeling it. Because of the overwhelming events recently academics-wise, I guess it hasn't fully sunk in with me. I get it, but I'm *just not feeling it.*

So tonight was the first meeting with the rest of our groupmates. We have just gotten home from the infirmary (and dinner) so overall we weren't exactly prepared to talk about with people. Man, I was just mum the entire thing. (Although I broke the ice for a bit when we logged on) But god, that was fucking stressful for me. I really could see how he was shaking beside me, clearly unprepared for the chat. And because I haven't claimed it as one of mine yet, I couldn't seem to form a complete thought that would totally rebut what the other guys were saying against our product. I get that it's criticism and probably inquiry to further understand what we want to put out there, but I honestly felt it was all plain attacking. Maybe because I'm such a fucking baby who can't take criticism (a hypocrite), but maybe also because there *is* some sort of elimination of teams on the second week. Like what I said to Daya, I expected the entire thing to be a sort of competition with everyone, but the forums proved me otherwise. I didn't feel like the criticism sounded *supportive* as in to like try to improve or try to let us explain further what our product was, but rather they were all very *_shutting down_* kind of words to me. It was just stressing me out the entire time (fan was off even and I was **_s w e a t i n g_**) and afterwards I'm just the stare-y me, wondering what I could've done differently. I could've cut them off any time, coming to his rescue (that I'm sure he doesn't need) and defending what we have. While I partly agree with their opinions, of course I'm full-on siding with my team duh. However, I have to say I was thankful that this other guy (who was Pinoy also) was sorta seeing how actually good (or at least that's how it came to me) of a "novelty" (his words) our product would become if it did rise up. So, thank you, cool guy, for being the supportive one in the group, and saying things I would have said (not your exact words, but the intention, I guess). There definitely were some words forming in my head but the stress was just clouding my train of thought that I'm sure I would just stutter on cam in front of all these grown men (and women) who, in my opinion, are just trying to race and take each other down.

Maybe that's just cynical me, but who knows. As much as their (initial) words and greetings are all friendly-*sounding*, I'm sure it's all for show and is just plain formality. After all, you keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. And well, you smile a lot to them too, of course.

*Ew, how distrustful are you, you piece of shit?*
