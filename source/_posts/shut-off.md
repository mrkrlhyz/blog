I haven't uttered a word to anyone since it happened.

How could you have been so dense? How could it have never occured to you that I no longer love, let alone care for you? 
How is it even possible to have the details shoved down your throat and still missed the point?
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense.

It's been five months.

And it blows my mind completely.

But it further proves my all my points. <!-- more --> 

~~pausing writing to look for my tweets.~~
~~Also, I just checked and apparently I didn't write about what happened.~~

> *that way i didn't have to picture you attending my graduation, introducing you to my parents, and __you simply lingering in my distant future.__*

> *__i thought we were going to be okay again.__ this isn't a new hurdle in the relationship. just a few months ago this same problem caused me to spiral into a relapse, and the next night i find myself racing away from sobriety. ...* 

> *__i can't keep going anymore. i've always thought we would last,__ but i guess i should never, ever assume again at the beginning of all things. the peak of the passion and the love. always at the beginning.*
> *and then we get spent, and find ourselves slipping down the steep slope, rolling downhill.*

> *__this has been an overdue breakup letter.__ i've been meaning to write one months ago, but i kept on sleeping on it in the hopes that we'll get better. i don't see that light anymore.*

> *and at this point, i'm constantly breaking and in dire need of utmost comfort, ... __i can't take this any longer,__ i can't keep waiting for the comfort that isn't coming.*

> *__but this__—whatever minute thing we have going on right now—__has to end now__. i can't keep this weighing me down every single day any longer. i just can't afford to fail anymore. i've been putting this off for weeks now. but i can't this time. i'm sorry.*

I just can't wrap my head around how you could have missed these all. I understand that it was a long thread, a lot to take in, but I didn't think you would really have it in you to shrug it off, and misread EVERYTHING completely.

*__EVERYTHING__*.

Unfathomable. Absolutely unbelievable. I really can't fucking *swallow* it.

It's been five months and I have moved on. 
I've told you stories about the people I've tried to date and hook up with. 
I've been cold and dismissive to you the past few months. You've been annoyingly clingy and it was annoying because you aren't important to me any longer and I didn't want to give any more of my time to you, but it appears that all this time, ALL THIS FUCKING TIME, you didn't have a fucking clue.

All this time you "seriously thought I was just busy." 
All this time you "seriously thought I was just going through immense sadness" when you read the thread.

**You were just proving me right.**

You couldn't take a second look. You couldn't be bothered to take the words in with all seriousness.
All you could tell me is that you're sorry because you have your problems too.
It was always about you and your problems. I've always put up with both of them. I've always tried to deal with them along with mine. But you could never deal with them along with me.

You should've just left me.

You've always put me aside. You've always kept me in the dark. All you had were all these meaningless words that you could never prove. 

Your words were like a fucking religion. 
I simply had to have faith in them so that they could be true in some sense.
But you could never EVER show me if they were ever true.
"I sincerely valued you, and it sucks that you feel that way." <small>(NV)</small>

Yeah. IT TRULY DOES.

"I got too comfortable that I won't lose you."

Commendable confidence. What I would fucking do to have it in such lengths.

I want to be able to sit pretty, neglecting my significant other, and have so much faith that we are absolutely fine and that the relationship is SURELY not on the rocks AND that my significant other still loves me wholeheartedly despite having received qualms from them about being dissatisifed and depressed with the relationship, and having been cold to each other for months on end.

*I JUST NEED TO HAVE THAT MUCH CONFIDENCE! PLEASE, FUCKING TEACH ME.*

it boggles my mind how you could have never thought that you have already lost me.

... 

I seriously have no more words to describe this situation. I still don't know what I'm feeling. Am I angry, or simply confused?

*Lost in all of this, maybe.*

I feel like I'm back to square one; to that point where I was when I was typing the letter. I found myself in tears in the middle of the conversation of clarifying the situation. I was shocked. In disbelief. All this goddamn time. All this fucking time. My words meant nothing to you. I finally poured out my everything, and they still didn't reach you. 

I shouldn't be so surprised. It has always been like this. My words and emotions were always irrelevant to you. You always had me feeling like being emotional was a bad thing. I despised showing you my emotions and refrained from opening up to you because you always looked at me with these eyes that could never stay for long, that couldn't care less, that couldn't have found me more ridiculous. *Ikaw na ang nagsabi*, you found the link irrelevant because it was on Twitter. Nevermind that it came from me, and that I politely asked you, *"Please read."* Nasa Twitter kasi, eh.

I shouldn't have been so surprised. But it has been months and I've just wanted to be at peace with myself. I was done with the days of questioning my worth, crying from the loneliness, from the negligence. I guess...I guess it's just that it's all rushing back and slapping me in the face that it hasn't really been over. You've reminded me of all the bitter feelings again. 

Congratulations, then. You've just made it worse for the both of us.
