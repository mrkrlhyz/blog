Hi again! I am alive ~~and well~~. It's a brand new year!

Just popping in for a quick update -- the blog just had a revamp and I suppose this is the official release of things. :) Finally was able to work on a previously mentioned theme reference. /pats self on the back

Now I'll keep this short since I have procrastinated on work and I should have slept 2 hours ago lmao.

Anyway, I'm just really proud of myself for having been this focused on finishing this, and I'm also really happy with the end result. (Not to mention I asked my first question on StackOverflow just a few minutes ago LOL)

The plan is to get back to blogging, and use this as my journal to track my, uh, feelings. Honestly can't wait to go back to writing things.

Oh well, that's all for now. I'm glad to be back here.
