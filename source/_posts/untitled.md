_your words pierce through me like knives._

and these were the only words repeating through my head as i helplessly cry into my hands.

how dare you say i don’t listen? how can you so effortlessly invalidate my efforts?

i’m sorry we’re not on the same page, but last time i checked i don’t police you because you don’t join rallies, i never police your choices

please just stop treating me like a fucking kid. i can’t believe how fast and unstoppable my tears run when you <!-- more --> speak to me like that.

you make me feel so small, so worthless. i feel dumb, i feel like shit, whenever i try to tell you something. and it sucks to feel this way. i know my intellect is infinitely lower than yours, i recognize that. it just fucking hurts to be stepped on like this.

and i know you probably mean well, but like i’ve always said -- ~~execution trumps intention~~ impact trumps intent. you don’t have a say to what your words made me feel, even if you didn’t intend to make me feel that way. there are many ways to say the words you wanted to get across, but your choices just crushed my heart.

i know i’m too emotional. i know you’ll get tired of this crap one day. it’s all cute and fun at the start. always just at the start, until you get enough. soon i’ll be too much to handle and it’ll be over. at least i can always say i’ve seen it coming.
