Redundancy method - a procedure practiced in scuba diving, and likely in other activities as well that we’ve come to overlook.

I’ve been keeping things -- pretty much everything -- on track: my to-do list, tasks, trivial day-to-day events... on Trello, on my journal, maybe here next. I’ve realized now how important it is that I keep a record of things. The many times I’ve swept under the rug the unrecorded, now forgotten ideas that could’ve been...it’s become a habit of mine to shrug off <!-- more --> seemingly trivial thoughts, just so I spare myself from any more bothersome voices in my head. This should come to an end now. Man, even the name of this blog I’ve forgotten where it came from. Although I’m certain that this was probably for some emotional shit again, there lies some meaning in the name of this blog that I can no longer recall. If it made for a specific purpose, I don’t know what it is anymore.

And so I’ve decided to constantly write notes in my journal -- to form a habit, and so that my journal earns my trust. I should know by now that I’m the only person who gets to hold it, so I should be able to entrust intimate thoughts with it. Write reminders on my calendar, on Trello, and on my journal as well, so that nothing slips my mind again. This semester is the time to switch up old habits, if I want to carry on with my future plans and graduate as planned - soon.
