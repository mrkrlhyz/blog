<small>_**now playing:** when am i gonna lose you - local natives_
<small>on repeat again for like the thousandth time just this week</small></small>

This day hasn't been as good as I would have wanted it to be. <!--more -->
Learned this morning that my ex died a few days ago. Fatal gunshot.
I didn't think I'd be affected, but here I am, writing about it. Not to mention I even cried about it shortly after hearing the news.

I'm still in shock and disbelief. We're not really friends anymore, but I suppose it's always shocking since we did share something in the past anyway. Maybe that's how empathy works. Maybe I have a heart anyway. I just didn't expect that I'd be _this_ affected. It's a shock that he has to go this way.

Haven't stopped thinking about it since this morning. I'm trying not to post/talk about it publicly because I don't feel like I have the right to. All the words I have in my head for him are clich√© words people usually say when someone has died. 
However I'm not trying to say that they aren't genuine. It's just really sad and shocking.

But maybe if I keep talking about it, it'll lose its meaning and I wouldn't be as sad anymore.

Maybe.

I've only pictured in my head how things are going to roll on Saturday when I see his corpse, but let's see how that's gonna go.
Hopefully I don't sleep in. That would be such a shame.
If this is how I'm gonna see him for the last time, then, okay.
I'd like to say goodbye, and thank you, and sorry.

_I'm getting so emotional right now._

To add to things, J*** has finally caught up with my lame responses from recent. Finally asking me if I'm alright.

No, sir, I haven't been alright. It's been a hellish three-something months.

I just didn't think today -- and now -- of all times, would be the time this would be brought up. Thought it'd be delayed again for many fucking weeks/months because I'm a coward who can't find the timing and words to cut ties with people besides cutting them off completely without word. It's just easier that way.
But I suppose it's better that way, just happen as it should, no warnings, no nothing, guard completely down while at it. Of course things don't always go as planned.

I was suppose to pastebin all this shit to him, but it turns out I am going to talk to him about it _today_. 

Gee. Great timing.

My heart is just getting heavier and heavier as I continue typing.

The song playing in the background isn't helping either.

But, it's true. I haven't been well. And even though there are days when I'm relatively better, I'm not going to discount the days where I feel completely helpless about the same recurring thing/problem. The fact that it's still there, and has _always_ been there, means I shouldn't ignore it. I shouldn't keep just crying it out, feeling sad, just to feel the same thing in a couple more days.

With that, I've considered going to therapy. I am also in disbelief at the amount of tears I cried two nights ago, drunk. I cried so much. It was one hell of a breakdown. My eyes were swollen the next day (good thing my bangs covered them well enough during the day). I haven't cried so much like that in long, but it must've been all the emotions and words and whatnot that I've swept under the rug (as I always do).


I don't want to make this any more emotional as it already is, but man... I could very well be losing two people today.

I don't know what kind of bearing the _heavier_ loss has for the future for me, but the probable second one, well...
I'd finally be free from the shackles holding me down for like half a month now. That fucking long, huh.

I shall go face this storm now. If it even happens tonight, might as well as early as today.



<small>_wait, when am i gonna lose you?_</small>
