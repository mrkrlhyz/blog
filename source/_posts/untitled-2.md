i’ve got a multitude of plans after college and almost all of them are flashing across my mind while in class today.

_oh my god, i want to make my chrome extension now. zzzz such distractions_

anyway, i plan to pretty much just study the heck after college in pursuit of knowledge. knowledge is infinite! i’d like to know as much as i can. i plan to exercise my maths while teaching in MIS by going back to kumon again. i don’t care if i’m old lol i do feel <!-- more --> like doing worksheets and crap again. it may be more feasible for me to go back while i’m in college but i don’t think i can be bothered to do the extra work every day. i’m already juggling enough.

anyway, here:

*   get teaching units after graduating
*   kumon while teaching at MIS and working on personal projects
*   MS at UPLB? still thinking about this
*   jap and french class during MS?

current plans...

*   finish this sem stronk
*   maybe work on something during the midyear
*   i think i’m going to S3/WSG instead of the top labs.
*   graduate.
