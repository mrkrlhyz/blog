I just spent a good long moment contemplating about my list of mental promises that I've made to my dog, that I've _still_ yet to fulfill, as I watch her find ways to position and entertain herself.

Everybody puts her needs second and it pains me to see the light that she used to have in her eyes gone now. Flickering and fading. There is unmistakable sadness everytime I look in them. I don't see the smile she used to have in her old photos. 

She just really wants to go inside. <!-- more --> You could be thinking: is that too much to ask? It's not. Not one bit. But they make it seem like it. 
You neglect her considerably and you antagonize her for asking for a little compassion; attention. You can barely sympathize with her. You obviously can't -- you haven't seen the way she reacts to human touch and warmth after being under the rain for hours.

I've kept on making a mental list of the things I'd like to buy for my precious dog to ease up her boredom when she's alone. A chew toy, and a bunch of other toys she can play with in her cage. A new bowl, some clean sponges to clean them. And her very own towel. A big fluffy one. And a new collar. Maybe she'll like that.

I guess my mind isn't in the right condition right now for me to write something coherent, but let this post mark my word: I'm going to put this promise first on my list this year. I'm not going to let January end without finally having my mental promises to her fulfilled. In my remaining days in the house, I'll be sure to take care of her as much as I can. When the time comes, I swear I'll be taking her out of here and keep close tabs on her. I'll really try my hardest to save you from this misery, baby. You'll be happy again. I promise. I love you, Muddy.
