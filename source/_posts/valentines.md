~~happy valentines.~~ this has got to be the saddest, loneliest valentines day ever.
<!-- more -->
I realized today that it's soon going to be a month since your death, and until now, it all still feels so surreal. I can't say I have completely gotten over it, because I still find myself getting sad, occasionally in tears when I think about you or try to "reach out" to you. 

I remembered you today, because it was the same day I said yes and we slow danced during UP Fair and it was one of the greatest nights of my life, looking back. I'm not sure if I'll ever have another night like that, because it just feels like everything is going downhill at this point. And this is where I always feel invalid, because I have no other memories to look back to except for the times we were together, and I know we both don't share the same feelings as we did then, but it just feels even lonelier that all I remember about you is you being mine. It's not true anymore, so everything else feels false. I don't know if I'm making sense, but that's how I feel right now, which is besides the fact that I'm in this supposed relationship that just seems to worsen the loneliness everyday.

Of course it's just me, but I caught your scent that I used to love the most-- that Armani scent that will always, always remind me of you -- about twice or thrice today. It's a delusion of mine, but I'd like to believe you were hanging around, passing by because you remember that night, too. But of course, it could be just other humans' scents wafting in the air because you're not the only person with that perfume. I'll hang on, however, to that sliver of hope that is my delusion because of all things that happened today, that is the only thing that lifts me up. 

This loneliness is so crippling, I swear one day I'll die from it.

Which brings me to another point.
The news of your death came along during a time when I was already in a low place. Sometimes I find myself getting "confused" at the sadness I'm feeling. Is it the loneliness, or is it the grief? Am I tired of being sad about being lonely so I choose to wallow in the grief that I *feel* like I've set aside? It's like, at this point, I'm choosing between the two sad places I have been and have been being in. It's just that the grief *"overlapped"* with the loneliness, that I set aside the loneliness for a while and faced the grief, and when I don't *feel* like grieving, I easily have something else to be sad about. **_I know it's so fucking confusing_**. I hate how I *have* something to be sad about and just *shuffle* and *shift* from one reason to the other. What the hell is this?

...

In any case, I don't wish to invalidate the fact that your death is something to be sad about today. I know to my core that if you were alive today, my mind would likely not flutter around the fact that *"oh, this could've been our nth anniversary"*, and I also do know that Valentines will always be significant to me because you were, are, and forever will be my first Valentine. My memory may not serve me well, but I'm pretty sure I remembered you last Valentines, and the one before that... I remembered you today, and I will remember you on the next, and even more so from that point onwards.

Everytime I go to work these days, I keep remembering about that day when I think I saw you on my way to work. I always wonder what I would have feel now if I did actually reach out to you then and asked if that was you, warranting a recent interaction between us before your death. I know it's useless to think about what-ifs now, but I just can't help it. 

Whenever I think about you (which is, not gonna lie, still frequent), sometimes it just fills me with comfort that you loved me the way you did, and that we shared something really special. And with that thought comes with another that says that I will never find the same kind of love ever. I can only hope that I will still, but right now, I don't see that light, honestly.

Right now I'm playing my grief playlist, which I haven't played in a while, but it still makes me sad, because everything about it just paints you. Our breakup songs, and songs I played while on the trip to see you... it's all sad. And when I remember you and I just wanna bask in the sadness and grief and your memory again, I have this playlist. I made other playlists in your memory, and also to help cope with and move on from the grief. It's something I have never felt so strongly before and I will also remember how much it crippled me at work, at home... 

I still haven't reactivated my Facebook, because I know the grief still lingers in the back of my mind. I realized that I will only have gotten over the grief once I find the willpower to not check your profile every few minutes, or backread our conversations. At this point, I can only see myself doing that if I come back, so I'm not trying to get back to it. I hope someone memorializes your account, and a part of me also wishes that somebody deactivates it so I can't see it anymore. But that is selfish of me, and is only dodging the problem further. I'm sure a lot of people would like to see your dumb meme-y Facebook profile. Plus, I'm a part of that profile. Unless somebody deletes that photo...

...

Honestly, at this point, I'm just spewing out words that I have in my head. I'm sure it's all pretty incoherent. I'm kinda tired now too, but I'm glad I was able to type this wall of text. I'm glad to have been able to have my thoughts materialize and not be stuck in my head. There are more important things to think about. 

I'll leave this as is.
