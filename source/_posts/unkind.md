Hi. 
This day didn't particularly go well for me, despite hopes of having it so.
I was energized better last week (sans the part of me getting sick), specifically last Tuesday when we had this strenuous circuit workout for PE. Surprisingly, I had much energy throughout the day and didn't feel sleepy.

Going back. I want to talk about today and what has been happening recently.

Day started off well. I woke up quite early, but still arrived late for class. It really sucks having had prepared early and not making it on time <!-- more --> still. It feels dumbing, to be honest. My workout went well, but felt dull. I wish I did better, but I decided to take it easy on some parts because it's been a week since my previous workout. I can't seem to build this sort of momentum so I can get better every meeting. Still no motivation to continue working out regularly so I can improve my weights. Sad.

A usual routine after PE class is going back to the dorm; riding a pedicab on the way there (from the jeepney stop). As I reached my payment to the driver and hopped off the pedicab, I overheard the driver mumbling and sort of cursing. I was able to make out he was saying something about the amount I gave him: 6 pesos. I've always known the fare was six pesos - no one really hasn't said anything as I gave them my coins. Just recently, I was able to share a ride with a child whose mother asked how much it would cost the child, and the driver responded the same amount. I have no idea if I gave the wrong amount, or kuya was just having a bad day or something. I wish I could've asked, but I was already a distance away and at that time wasn't sure if I was hearing things right. At first it ticked me off that he didn't tell me properly if I *did* give him the wrong amount; mumbling to yourself and cursing your passenger is rude and doesn't really help with anything. But in any case, he has all the right to complain for such a scant amount he wasn't (probably) expecting. On my part, I just wish he told me properly. I wouldn't have hesitated to give him the amount he asks (given that it isn't overboard). This has been tugging at me at the back of my head, also getting paranoid that he has remembered where I live or what I look like and has ordered someone (or has plotted himself) to have me killed. Fuck. I really hope not.

Ah, I forgot to tell about my dream from last night/this morning.
I dreamt about James, my ex. I dreamt that we met up, and from what it seems, he was still into me. He was quite clingy, and I have to admit it was a refreshing moment spending time with him again. (Looking back, though, he doesn't really act as clingy and affectionate in person.) In my dream, I was aware that I was currently in a relationship, and that what I was doing isn't harmful or wrong. We're merely meeting as friends anyway. James and I proceeded to sit on a bench in a mall, and for some reason he starts kissing my neck. I asked him to stop - I was uncomfortable because I *am* in a relationship, but he insisted on going. I was also hesitant because I know he's also in a relationship. So, I let it happen. And it was just weird. Because admittedly, I think I would have acted the same way if it happened in real life. My "*true colors*" showed in that dream for sure. *__God damn it runs in the blood.__* My cheating tendencies manifested in my dream, and it's not impossible to happen. 
Anyway, the next thing is that I fetch my current boyfriend (in my dream...and it's not Miah. Strange) who apparently works in a restaurant/food place in the mall where we were. He met me outside his workplace in tears, asking what do I think I'm doing -- implying he knows I've met up with my ex (maybe he saw what he was doing to me too, idk). He was tall, in a cook's outfit. I don't know who he is in real life. He seems to resemble James as well -- works in the kitchen and is taller than I am. The usual "I can explain" was exchanged but he refused to hear it. I don't remember what happened next but I think I turned conscious that Miah was out of the context, and wondered why. My memory can't recall any more other scenes except for me trying to text the boyfriend to apologize/explain, and his contact name on my phone was Charles. So I guess he's my former gig buddy, Charles. Idk.

Moving on.

Walked to PI 100 class and arrived to, well, no classes. Sucks. I was actually looking forward to learning something at PI class for once because I've missed so many meetings already. That was a bummer for me, not gonna lie.

After Geol class, I decided to drop by the human rights ED today to refresh my memory (and add some stuff as well, I guess), and I arrived quite early at the place. Found a number of people in the room so early and doubted they were the applicants. Sucks, I don't even have that */command/* as a member to ask if they were applicants, jeez. Some of the members came in a few minutes after, and I couldn't feel more alone and *isolated* in a room of people, who also happen to be my orgmates. I felt so out of place -- a feeling so familiar, I don't think I will never stop experiencing it. It also feels like a slap on the face that I wasn't able to harness much meaningful friendships in college like I hoped to back in the day. It is my graduating year and I still only recognize one - *__one__* friend, in my entire college circle. 

*got distracted zzz*

I criticized the pres of my other org anonymously. And some of the execomm seems to be taking it the wrong way lol sure, I really am starting to see the toxicity of the internals of the org as relayed to me, tbh. Straightforward is not being inconstructive. Please do take note of the things I said because I am simply relaying to you (anonymously) what the others can't say straight to your face (because they're not as assholey as you are)

...

Anyway, I lost the mood. Kinda just want to sleep at this point. Good night.
