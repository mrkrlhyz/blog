    - dealing with grief

(it's like 2 AM and I'm just sneaking this in because I don't want to forget things, but my mind's hazy so please forgive the incoherent writing)

<!-- more -->

I dreamt of James last night. Well, sort of. I dreamt that I went to Black Scoop UPTC (not sure if this place even exists, but from what I've seen, it seems that he used to work at Black Scoop.) and for some reason, had a chat with his former workmates. In my dream, he didn't stay long in that job and most of the staff were new ones, so I was assuming only a few of them knew. My first question was who has been working on the job for the longest time among them, and one girl answered. I asked her if she knew what happened, and she said yes. We kinda talked about it like how I would usually talk about it to other people, but honestly other than that, I don't remember much anymore. The whole gist of the scene was just me bringing it up again to others who might've known him.

(I'll update this tomorrow or something, but for reference:)
- I found the perfect "painting" of grief while browsing Reddit. (The original comment is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))

> Grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

> In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

> Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or a special day. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

> The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.
