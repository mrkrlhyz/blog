Hi.

So, apparently I’ve had this blog lying around for who-knows-how long. I decided to make a temporary blog to dump my thoughts for now while my personal blog is about to go under construction, since I didn't think my bujo or Trello would just cut for writing... (sorry, bujo.) Opting for a simple blogging platform with nice minimalist themes (because I’m petty like that), I went ahead and registered with my primary e-mail and, questionably, it’s already in use.

So I’ve had this site <!-- more --> existing for a while now, it seems. I can’t even remember how I came up with the title but, as confusing it sounds to me, I don’t feel like changing it to the handle I was originally thinking of using.

Anyway...I’ve started blabbing.

I’ve been eyeing on having personal projects and I’ve come up with -- yay -- two ideas! :) One is a personal blog/website, and the other is a site for teachers that my Philo 11 professor suggested to the class. Coincidentally, while looking around Medium for something to read (maybe), I came across an article re: face recognition, and boom, sparked something in my brain to maybe actually do the teachers’ website idea. Although I feel like it’s going to come in secondary, as I’ve been eyeing more on creating my own new blog/site primarily this past couple of days...and honestly, I don’t want to get distracted anymore.

But hey, not bad to list down references and ideas (?) so far, yeah? (I should tag the posts here with the relevant stuff. Cool, cool.)

**Teachers’ Website Project** (aka Project 2)

**Personal site** (aka Project 1) (Edit: you're here now. :) )

Ideas (so far):

~~1.  Embed a handy Twitter app on the site where I can tweet directly to my private Twitter. (cause I should really practice just tweeting to myself...who reads my tweets anyway?)~~ (Edit: Decided I'm not going to fully expose myself because this blog is _"partially"_ public.)

Here's to focusing on personal projects and improving on web development this year! Off to get some zzz's. (Glad to finally have published a post tonight.) **_<small>msl</small>_**
