Hi. Long time no post.

Just wanted to put this out here: https://screenshots.firefox.com/BCX7hDz7NaIYTKvT/msu.edu
It's a screenshot of mine of a website where this poem called The Hollow Men is written, and I just maybe sort of fell in love with the site layout.
I'm kind of driven to design my next theme after this one. Hngh, forgive my lack of creative juices. I'll try to sketch something a bit different than this. >_<
The past few weeks have been nice to me, btw. Okay, bye.
