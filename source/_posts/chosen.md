woke up on this "early" saturday morning feeling inexplicably sad. 

worse, i can't remember my dreams - a possible root of why i "woke up like this". 

and because i can't remember my dreams, my mind afloats to other plausible reasons of this morning sadness. 
did my precious muddy wake up okay today? i'm sorry i haven't been around to give you cuddles, bbgirl. i miss you.

is it my childhood? somehow my mind started picturing me typing away on my blog; something about how i've actually been always <!-- more -->  quiet and never really talked much, and that my parents wouldn't know anything that i've been thinking, and how it's always been that way -- like how i used to have this subddomain where i honestly poured out my thoughts and feelings: things that they've never heard directly from me. it's always from some other source, allbeit still adjacent to me. 

is it because my birthday is coming soon, and my mind and body have just become accustomed to being sad weeks before the day, ever since ~4 years ago? i regard this as unlikely, but it crossed my mind anyway.

i'm just looking forward to what transpires today, and hopefully it lifts my spirits. there are supposedly exciting events today, but my mood is just pulling me down right now.

i hate sadness stemming from the unknown. i need justification to why i'm feeling this way.

.

i'm suddenly reminded of this post i read last night, about why we experience unexplainable sadness (it's from tumblr, so don't quote me on this), and it goes somewhere along these lines: some souls have no one to mourn for them, so a person randomly gets assigned to mourn for that person.

given this situation, i believe my first assumption cancels out because my sister would mourn for my dear dog.

and if it really was true, then i'm sorry. whoever it is, may you rest in peace.

i should give myself a pat on the back for being able to write something again today, instead of just picturing the words being typed on the damn screen.
screw me and my lack of motivation to do anything. 

videotape - radiohead, on repeat.	**_msl_**
