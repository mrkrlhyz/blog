So, finally, the blog is up! Finally a personal project crossed off my list. 

##### I hope this thing never sees the light of day.

Maybe tomorrow I'll "import" some of my Tumblr posts onto here for some more ___content___. I'd like to think I've written quite a bunch of good stuff there.

I've planned what to write for my first blog post, and it wasn't supposed to be an ***init commit*** sort of thing but I guess here we are; trying to make the most of being an "official" dev. ~~dev debut?~~ <!-- more --> Fuck this shit. I'm not supposed to be starting on development this late in my college life. I guess this is where I regret dilly-dallying in my first few years of college, and sulk in envy at my "CS Lord" batchmates, working on cool projects and startups and all that shit. (But that's for another story.)

But hey, to be fair, designing this blog really brought me back to my childhood -- back to when I was still starting out with this whole coding thing (10 years ago). I didn't know shit, I didn't know crap about documentation; coding HTML/CSS for me was to rely on intuition. I'd like to think that CSS declarations are pretty intuitive, so that's where I played around (that is, given the basecode I was working on top of *was* intuitive enough. All about the base(code).). It was insert-a-line-of-code-and-hope-for-the-best-after-the-page-refreshes kind of thing. I have to admit I've brought that attitude to now, so you could say I'm _still_ "playing around" with stuff. Type in a line and hope things would work as I wanted to. If it doesn't, I'll ask DuckDuckGo. :/

I'd bet my life on Python docs, but never take a peek at HTML/CSS docs. Nice. Sucks.
~~Force of habit, I guess.~~ I know that's a dumb excuse. I'm trying to work on it.

I guess that's all I have to say for now, but I must also add that I'm really proud of myself for finishing this. Despite countless refreshes and server restarts just to see a change for a line of code I added/modified/removed, I'm also proud that I didn't tire of this plain white theme (that I designed, yay!). I'm that sort of guy who likes seeing a change of "scenery" every now and then (I need a new color scheme for my text editor every so often, okay), and I'm glad I'm not ditching this theme yet! (for fuck's sake, I'm just about to "start" using it.) I've a long way to go with my web dev skills, and producing this ___bare minimum___ theme (hey, I should call it that) is, well, the bare minimum, but fuck what anyone says -- I'm proud that I was driven enough to finish this entire thing. I'm really happy to have completed this personal project of mine. (The domain shall come some time in the future.)

Also gotta thank Hexo for making this shit possible. (Also proud of myself for learning to navigate around this crap pretty quickly!) And of course my boyfriend for helping me out along the way. :) (Thank you bb! I hope you never get to read this.)

Hooray for milestones and trying out new things!
Time to read on some stuff. Ja ne.
