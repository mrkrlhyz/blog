i jolted awake this morning, gasping for air.
i saw myself in a dream that grasped its hands around my neck so tightly; in the last kind of dream i'd want to ever have.

i dreamt that he invited his ex over without letting me know beforehand, and in my dream, he has made it known to me that previously he's considered this girl as someone he wanted to marry.
i heard the girl's voice in my dream so vividly, and it's the voice of no one i know in real life. unfamiliar and <!-- more --> haunting.
they were laughing and talking so gleefully and carefree as i was suffocating in the background. it felt like i was being replaced in that moment right in front of my face. you couldn't get rid of the smiles on their faces -- they were clearly and evidently in love with each other.
it crushed me every moment my eyes would catch a glimpse of them. they looked so happy.
i was running back and forth across the room, making so much noise and crying hardly while packing my bags, but they hardly noticed me.
i just wanted to speed out the door at that moment. while shoving a piece of clothing in my bag, i woke up. i was catching my breath.
i needed quite the time to collect myself and take in the reality. it blew so hard. i was asleep in the same exact room i was moving in my dream, nothing changed, even my paper bag was there with all my skincare stuff... only difference from the now is that there was just someone there whom he basked in happiness with that wasn't me.

i was wondering what this dream meant; is it a manifestation of my current fears? is it our current situation (at least in my perspective)? that he makes decision without my knowledge and that sometimes he acts without considering what i would feel. and the fear of being so easily replaced has always been with me, and this is the worst haunting yet. it's not even real, but i feel so shaken. i have never in my life jolted awake catching my breath. until today.

as far as comforting myself can go, i know he doesn't invite anyone else over at his place. for now, that gives me the utmost comfort that prevents the situation from happening. but of course, knowing myself, i'm known to contradict these facts by being overly pessimistic with my thoughts, all these goddamned "what if"'s that can never be put to rest in my head. i always need the external validation and consolation from someone to refute my disturbing thoughts. it's stupid. it's like i can never rely on myself, right? i guess this dream can be taken as a slap in the face -- that things can happen around you even without you knowing (this has been happening, so i should know), and that, as much as it sucks, you can always be replaced by someone "better." and that maybe dreams can really reflect your thoughts, even those in the back of your mind.

i have to mention too that i saw my ex in my dream. i talked to him again, and for some reason still looking for some glint of feelings for me. it's something i seem to always do, for some stupid reason. but he's obviously moved on from me, even introducing to me his current girl in my dream. that's all cool, though. from the way they looked in my dream and anywhere visible, i'm glad that they're happy with each other. 

i wish for myself to be completely and absolutely contented too, without having to settle for less and compromising what i am truly happy in. one day.
