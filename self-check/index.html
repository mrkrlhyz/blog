        <p><p>Congratulations, self, for making it through another month without your birth control failing on you for being so inconsistent with your intake. Great job.<br>I must also offer kudos for a minimal overthinking on possible <em>asymptomatic</em> pregnancy. Man, you can never shake it off, can’t you. </p>
<p>Thought I’d <em>formally</em> update this thing. It has been a while.<br><em>Oh, exactly a month ago it seems (just checked). Cool.</em></p>
<p>Currently I’m still hooked on Stardew Valley, and so is my boyfriend; it keeps me distracted and left with unfinished homeworks and tasks and abandoned <a id="more"></a> plans. I should seriously try to keep away from this soon; we have started on our thesis recently and I really have to focus on this. It’s my last two semesters and I cannot afford to fail any longer. In other news, our thesis is, so far, proving itself promising and my only friend in the university happens to be my thesis partner. I’ve been “blessed”, so I shouldn’t even attempt to complain. I’m in my dream lab with my bestfriend; I should be more than content.</p>
<p>Speaking of boyfriend, he has been, well, back to “”normal””, should I say? He has become more affectionate (again), seemingly like he’s trying to make up for lost time. Not sure how long this will last before he becomes busy again, but of course my gut tells me that I shouldn’t try to suck it all up again. I spent the entire week at his place and heard some of the things I’ve been scared to hear (re: things he does when I’m around vs. when I’m not around.) Next week I shall try to <em>“”regulate””</em> again so I can also grant him some alone time. I must say I appreciate him so much recently — for the first time in months he came to UP again to visit me, and went to the dorm with me, too. He has been consistently inviting me to play Stardew Valley or watch Black Mirror. Not to mention he’s been cooking for me (us) again (even wakes up early for it so I can eat early before class, too). Yesterday he told me “he worries too”, asking me my whereabouts because it has been an hour then since I told him I was on my way home. My heart totally melted in the crummy Ministop chair; my ass totally assumed he just needed something again.<br>Honestly, something tells me he asked for advice about this, but some part of me also completely doubts that; but who knows, maybe he has opened up to his bestfriend. I also cannot lie, too, that I expect another downtime after this, which is why a <em>“”regulation””</em> should always be in order.</p>
<p>Well, what else. He wants to do a startup, and I guess I’ll be a dev in it. Sounds really fun; I’d honestly go for it for free lol, all I’d need is time with him and I’m good. Sounds clingy as fuck but I’d take it in a heartbeat, damn.<br>I really wish, though, that I was more preoccupied with what he has tasked me to do that frickin Stardew. But then again, he causes my distraction too because he constantly invites me to play with him. </p>
<p>But yeah, of course I haven’t written anything down on here, but since June-July, it was almost every damn day that I would picture myself typing words on this damned text editor — a breakup letter. I’ve told my bestfriend multiple fucking times that I’d break up with him soon, next week, whatever. But it would never happen; of course I’d/we’d always feel “okay” towards him/each other on the day/s I’ve decided I’ll finally break it off. It’s not the first time this has happened. And so until now I haven’t broken up with anyone yet, and still unacquainted with how it feels to be the one to break up with someone. Many times I saw in my head the breakup letter changing its words — its introduction specifically — about how it’s supposedly a letter for breaking up with him but because things have looked up, I’ve decided against it. I’m still thinking whether I’ll send him something. I probably should. Everyday always feel so casual and we don’t really talk about our relationship, so, yeah. I guess I’ll send him something some time soon. It should also help drive a conversation about how we’ll go about with what we have. Man, I haven’t introduced him to my parents yet. I already want to so bad, but I’m also thinking maybe grad would be a good time, too. I’m just really worried what they’ll think about the stupid age gap, but other than that I’m not really worried about anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that’s more than enough of an entry. I’ve gotten distracted while writing the previous paragraph and the drowsiness is also overtaking by now (1:43AM on my clock) so I guess I’m ending it here. I’m pretty satisfied with how this went; I’m glad I was able to write this damn wall of text. I thought it was going to be just another picture in my mind; a plan I’ll never begin on. Good rainy night.</p>
