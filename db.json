I didn't feel like the criticism sounded *supportive* as in to like try to improve or try to let us explain further what our product was, but rather they were all very *_shutting down_* kind of words to me. It was just stressing me out the entire time (fan was off even and I was **_s w e a t i n g_**) and afterwards I'm just the stare-y me, wondering what I could've done differently.

I’ve realized now how important it is that I keep a record of things. The many times I’ve swept under the rug the unrecorded, now forgotten ideas that could’ve been...it’s become a habit of mine to shrug off <!-- more --> seemingly trivial thoughts, just so I spare myself from any more bothersome voices in my head. This should come to an end now. Man, even the name of this blog I’ve forgotten where it came from. Although I’m certain that this was probably for some emotional shit again, there lies some meaning in the name of this blog that I can no longer recall. If it made for a specific purpose, I don’t know what it is anymore.\n\nAnd so I’ve decided to constantly write notes in my journal -- to form a habit, and so that my journal earns my trust.

(Also proud of myself for learning to navigate around this crap pretty quickly!) And of course my boyfriend for helping me out along the way. :) (Thank you bb! I hope you never get to read this.)</p>\n<p>Hooray for milestones and trying out new things!<br>Time to read on some stuff.

Flickering and fading. There is unmistakable sadness everytime I look in them. I don’t see the smile she used to have in her old photos. </p>\n<p>She just really wants to go inside.","more":"You could be thinking: is that too much to ask? It’s not. Not one bit. But they make it seem like it.<br>You neglect her considerably and you antagonize her for asking for a little compassion; attention. You can barely sympathize with her. You obviously can’t – you haven’t seen the way she reacts to human touch and warmth after being under the rain for hours.</p>\n<p>I’ve kept on making a mental list of the things I’d like to buy for my precious dog to ease up her boredom when she’s alone. A chew toy, and a bunch of other toys she can play with in her cage. A new bowl, some clean sponges to clean them. And her very own towel. A big fluffy one. And a new collar. Maybe she’ll like that.</p>\n<p>I guess my mind isn’t in the right condition right now for me to write something coherent, but let this post mark my word: I’m going to put this promise first on my list this year. I’m not going to let January end without finally having my mental promises to her fulfilled. In my remaining days in the house, I’ll be sure to take care of her as much as I can.

In other news, our thesis is, so far, proving itself promising and my only friend in the university happens to be my thesis partner. I've been \"blessed\", so I shouldn't even attempt to complain. I'm in my dream lab with my bestfriend; I should be more than content.\n\nSpeaking of boyfriend, he has been, well, back to \"\"normal\"\", should I say? He has become more affectionate (again), seemingly like he's trying to make up for lost time. Not sure how long this will last before he becomes busy again, but of course my gut tells me that I shouldn't try to suck it all up again. I spent the entire week at his place and heard some of the things I've been scared to hear (re: things he does when I'm around vs. when I'm not around.) Next week I shall try to _\"\"regulate\"\"_ again so I can also grant him some alone time. I must say I appreciate him so much recently — for the first time in months he came to UP again to visit me, and went to the dorm with me, too. He has been consistently inviting me to play Stardew Valley or watch Black Mirror. Not to mention he's been cooking for me (us) again (even wakes up early for it so I can eat early before class, too). Yesterday he told me \"he worries too\", asking me my whereabouts because it has been an hour then since I told him I was on my way home. My heart totally melted in the crummy Ministop chair; my ass totally assumed he just needed something again. \nHonestly, something tells me he asked for advice about this, but some part of me also completely doubts that; but who knows, maybe he has opened up to his bestfriend. I also cannot lie, too, that I expect another downtime after this, which is why a _\"\"regulation\"\"_ should always be in order.\n\nWell, what else. He wants to do a startup, and I guess I'll be a dev in it. Sounds really fun; I'd honestly go for it for free lol, all I'd need is time with him and I'm good. Sounds clingy as fuck but I'd take it in a heartbeat, damn. \nI really wish, though, that I was more preoccupied with what he has tasked me to do that frickin Stardew. But then again, he causes my distraction too because he constantly invites me to play with him. \n\nBut yeah, of course I haven't written anything down on here, but since June-July, it was almost every damn day that I would picture myself typing words on this damned text editor — a breakup letter. I've told my bestfriend multiple fucking times that I'd break up with him soon, next week, whatever. But it would never happen; of course I'd/we'd always feel \"okay\" towards him/each other on the day/s I've decided I'll finally break it off. It's not the first time this has happened. And so until now I haven't broken up with anyone yet, and still unacquainted with how it feels to be the one to break up with someone. Many times I saw in my head the breakup letter changing its words — its introduction specifically — about how it's supposedly a letter for breaking up with him but because things have looked up, I've decided against it. I'm still thinking whether I'll send him something. I probably should. Everyday always feel so casual and we don't really talk about our relationship, so, yeah. I guess I'll send him something some time soon. It should also help drive a conversation about how we'll go about with what we have. Man, I haven't introduced him to my parents yet. I already want to so bad, but I'm also thinking maybe grad would be a good time, too. I'm just really worried what they'll think about the stupid age gap, but other than that I'm not really worried about anything.\n\nAnyway, I think that's more than enough of an entry. I've gotten distracted while writing the previous paragraph and the drowsiness is also overtaking by now (1:43AM on my clock) so I guess I'm ending it here.

Surprisingly, I had much energy throughout the day and didn't feel sleepy.\n\nGoing back. I want to talk about today and what has been happening recently.\n\nDay started off well. I woke up quite early, but still arrived late for class. It really sucks having had prepared early and not making it on time <!-- more --> still. It feels dumbing, to be honest. My workout went well, but felt dull. I wish I did better, but I decided to take it easy on some parts because it's been a week since my previous workout. I can't seem to build this sort of momentum so I can get better every meeting. Still no motivation to continue working out regularly so I can improve my weights. Sad.\n\nA usual routine after PE class is going back to the dorm; riding a pedicab on the way there (from the jeepney stop). As I reached my payment to the driver and hopped off the pedicab, I overheard the driver mumbling and sort of cursing. I was able to make out he was saying something about the amount I gave him: 6 pesos. I've always known the fare was six pesos - no one really hasn't said anything as I gave them my coins. Just recently, I was able to share a ride with a child whose mother asked how much it would cost the child, and the driver responded the same amount. I have no idea if I gave the wrong amount, or kuya was just having a bad day or something. I wish I could've asked, but I was already a distance away and at that time wasn't sure if I was hearing things right. At first it ticked me off that he didn't tell me properly if I *did* give him the wrong amount; mumbling to yourself and cursing your passenger is rude and doesn't really help with anything. But in any case, he has all the right to complain for such a scant amount he wasn't (probably) expecting. On my part, I just wish he told me properly. I wouldn't have hesitated to give him the amount he asks (given that it isn't overboard). This has been tugging at me at the back of my head, also getting paranoid that he has remembered where I live or what I look like and has ordered someone (or has plotted himself) to have me killed. Fuck. I really hope not.\n\nAh, I forgot to tell about my dream from last night/this morning.\nI dreamt about James, my ex. I dreamt that we met up, and from what it seems, he was still into me. He was quite clingy, and I have to admit it was a refreshing moment spending time with him again. (Looking back, though, he doesn't really act as clingy and affectionate in person.) In my dream, I was aware that I was currently in a relationship, and that what I was doing isn't harmful or wrong. We're merely meeting as friends anyway. James and I proceeded to sit on a bench in a mall, and for some reason he starts kissing my neck. I asked him to stop - I was uncomfortable because I *am* in a relationship, but he insisted on going. I was also hesitant because I know he's also in a relationship. So, I let it happen. And it was just weird. Because admittedly, I think I would have acted the same way if it happened in real life. My \"*true colors*\" showed in that dream for sure. *__God damn it runs in the blood.__* My cheating tendencies manifested in my dream, and it's not impossible to happen. \nAnyway, the next thing is that I fetch my current boyfriend (in my dream...and it's not Miah. Strange) who apparently works in a restaurant/food place in the mall where we were. He met me outside his workplace in tears, asking what do I think I'm doing -- implying he knows I've met up with my ex (maybe he saw what he was doing to me too, idk). He was tall, in a cook's outfit. I don't know who he is in real life. He seems to resemble James as well -- works in the kitchen and is taller than I am. The usual \"I can explain\" was exchanged but he refused to hear it. I don't remember what happened next but I think I turned conscious that Miah was out of the context, and wondered why. My memory can't recall any more other scenes except for me trying to text the boyfriend to apologize/explain, and his contact name on my phone was Charles. So I guess he's my former gig buddy, Charles. Idk.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWalked to PI 100 class and arrived to, well, no classes. Sucks. I was actually looking forward to learning something at PI class for once because I've missed so many meetings already. That was a bummer for me, not gonna lie.\n\nAfter Geol class, I decided to drop by the human rights ED today to refresh my memory (and add some stuff as well, I guess), and I arrived quite early at the place. Found a number of people in the room so early and doubted they were the applicants. Sucks, I don't even have that */command/* as a member to ask if they were applicants, jeez. Some of the members came in a few minutes after, and I couldn't feel more alone and *isolated* in a room of people, who also happen to be my orgmates. I felt so out of place -- a feeling so familiar, I don't think I will never stop experiencing it. It also feels like a slap on the face that I wasn't able to harness much meaningful friendships in college like I hoped to back in the day. It is my graduating year and I still only recognize one - *__one__* friend, in my entire college circle. \n\n*got distracted zzz*\n\nI criticized the pres of my other org anonymously. And some of the execomm seems to be taking it the wrong way lol sure, I really am starting to see the toxicity of the internals of the org as relayed to me, tbh. Straightforward is not being inconstructive. Please do take note of the things I said because I am simply relaying to you (anonymously) what the others can't say straight to your face (because they're not as assholey as you are)\n\n...\n\nAnyway, I lost the mood.
