I'm part of a startup now.\n\nWell, it's my boyfriend's startup. Not sure if it was made on a whim (probably not, probably yeah), but it was an abrupt and sudden event being part of it.\nIt was like, hey, you're part of a mini company now, whose product you will know as we go.\n\nYeah, I know right.\n\nIt was all sudden. I've always wanted to work on a startup, but not at this point where I <!-- more --> wanted to focus most on my thesis. I lose everything if I fail this. I need to graduate within the year. The pressure is intense and a startup is not what I need at this point; but here I am anyway. I would say I was *forced* into this, but hey, I agreed. Is it coercion? *Partly yes.* I feel ashamed to decline but at the same time I do really want to be a part of this team. I've *always* wanted to work with him. And now I am. \n\nIt's just that the worktime is rapid and pressured because of Startup School. It's a ten-week program and I believe we have to catch up to something (just learned this today, jeezus) else we get removed from the group or something. Crazy. He's the only one working on the startup full-time. I would really recommend him getting another someone else to work with him (but who knows if he's already done that.) \n\nLike previously mentioned, this was all so abrupt; unexpected. I still haven't find my place in the startup and can't seem to claim it as my own yet as of now. I always refer to it as *__his__ startup* even though I'm technically a part of it. Haven't talked to the other guy as well so I'm honestly not feeling it. Because of the overwhelming events recently academics-wise, I guess it hasn't fully sunk in with me. I get it, but I'm *just not feeling it.*\n\nSo tonight was the first meeting with the rest of our groupmates. We have just gotten home from the infirmary (and dinner) so overall we weren't exactly prepared to talk about with people. Man, I was just mum the entire thing. (Although I broke the ice for a bit when we logged on) But god, that was fucking stressful for me. I really could see how he was shaking beside me, clearly unprepared for the chat. And because I haven't claimed it as one of mine yet, I couldn't seem to form a complete thought that would totally rebut what the other guys were saying against our product. I get that it's criticism and probably inquiry to further understand what we want to put out there, but I honestly felt it was all plain attacking. Maybe because I'm such a fucking baby who can't take criticism (a hypocrite), but maybe also because there *is* some sort of elimination of teams on the second week. Like what I said to Daya, I expected the entire thing to be a sort of competition with everyone, but the forums proved me otherwise. I didn't feel like the criticism sounded *supportive* as in to like try to improve or try to let us explain further what our product was, but rather they were all very *_shutting down_* kind of words to me. It was just stressing me out the entire time (fan was off even and I was **_s w e a t i n g_**) and afterwards I'm just the stare-y me, wondering what I could've done differently. I could've cut them off any time, coming to his rescue (that I'm sure he doesn't need) and defending what we have. While I partly agree with their opinions, of course I'm full-on siding with my team duh. However, I have to say I was thankful that this other guy (who was Pinoy also) was sorta seeing how actually good (or at least that's how it came to me) of a \"novelty\" (his words) our product would become if it did rise up. So, thank you, cool guy, for being the supportive one in the group, and saying things I would have said (not your exact words, but the intention, I guess). There definitely were some words forming in my head but the stress was just clouding my train of thought that I'm sure I would just stutter on cam in front of all these grown men (and women) who, in my opinion, are just trying to race and take each other down.\n\nMaybe that's just cynical me, but who knows. As much as their (initial) words and greetings are all friendly-*sounding*, I'm sure it's all for show and is just plain formality. After all, you keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. And well, you smile a lot to them too, of course.\n\n*Ew, how distrustful are you, you piece of shit?*\n","source":"_posts/a-bit-shaken.md","raw":"---\ntitle: a bit shaken\ndate: 2018-09-03 23:40:36\ntags:\n    - mild bullcrap\ncategories:\n    - [life]\n    - [dev]\n---\n\nI don't think I've said anything on this blog yet since it's fairly recent news but, yeah.

I've always wanted to work on a startup, but not at this point where I <!-- more --> wanted to focus most on my thesis. I lose everything if I fail this. I need to graduate within the year. The pressure is intense and a startup is not what I need at this point; but here I am anyway. I would say I was *forced* into this, but hey, I agreed. Is it coercion? *Partly yes.* I feel ashamed to decline but at the same time I do really want to be a part of this team. I've *always* wanted to work with him. And now I am. \n\nIt's just that the worktime is rapid and pressured because of Startup School. It's a ten-week program and I believe we have to catch up to something (just learned this today, jeezus) else we get removed from the group or something. Crazy. He's the only one working on the startup full-time. I would really recommend him getting another someone else to work with him (but who knows if he's already done that.) \n\nLike previously mentioned, this was all so abrupt; unexpected. I still haven't find my place in the startup and can't seem to claim it as my own yet as of now. I always refer to it as *__his__ startup* even though I'm technically a part of it. Haven't talked to the other guy as well so I'm honestly not feeling it. Because of the overwhelming events recently academics-wise, I guess it hasn't fully sunk in with me. I get it, but I'm *just not feeling it.*\n\nSo tonight was the first meeting with the rest of our groupmates. We have just gotten home from the infirmary (and dinner) so overall we weren't exactly prepared to talk about with people. Man, I was just mum the entire thing. (Although I broke the ice for a bit when we logged on) But god, that was fucking stressful for me. I really could see how he was shaking beside me, clearly unprepared for the chat. And because I haven't claimed it as one of mine yet, I couldn't seem to form a complete thought that would totally rebut what the other guys were saying against our product. I get that it's criticism and probably inquiry to further understand what we want to put out there, but I honestly felt it was all plain attacking. Maybe because I'm such a fucking baby who can't take criticism (a hypocrite), but maybe also because there *is* some sort of elimination of teams on the second week. Like what I said to Daya, I expected the entire thing to be a sort of competition with everyone, but the forums proved me otherwise. I didn't feel like the criticism sounded *supportive* as in to like try to improve or try to let us explain further what our product was, but rather they were all very *_shutting down_* kind of words to me. It was just stressing me out the entire time (fan was off even and I was **_s w e a t i n g_**) and afterwards I'm just the stare-y me, wondering what I could've done differently. I could've cut them off any time, coming to his rescue (that I'm sure he doesn't need) and defending what we have. While I partly agree with their opinions, of course I'm full-on siding with my team duh. However, I have to say I was thankful that this other guy (who was Pinoy also) was sorta seeing how actually good (or at least that's how it came to me) of a \"novelty\" (his words) our product would become if it did rise up. So, thank you, cool guy, for being the supportive one in the group, and saying things I would have said (not your exact words, but the intention, I guess).

Great job. \nI must also offer kudos for a minimal overthinking on possible _asymptomatic_ pregnancy. Man, you can never shake it off, can't you. \n\nThought I'd _formally_ update this thing. It has been a while. \n_Oh, exactly a month ago it seems (just checked). Cool._\n\nCurrently I'm still hooked on Stardew Valley, and so is my boyfriend; it keeps me distracted and left with unfinished homeworks and tasks and abandoned <!-- more --> plans. I should seriously try to keep away from this soon; we have started on our thesis recently and I really have to focus on this. It's my last two semesters and I cannot afford to fail any longer. In other news, our thesis is, so far, proving itself promising and my only friend in the university happens to be my thesis partner. I've been \"blessed\", so I shouldn't even attempt to complain. I'm in my dream lab with my bestfriend; I should be more than content.\n\nSpeaking of boyfriend, he has been, well, back to \"\"normal\"\", should I say? He has become more affectionate (again), seemingly like he's trying to make up for lost time. Not sure how long this will last before he becomes busy again, but of course my gut tells me that I shouldn't try to suck it all up again. I spent the entire week at his place and heard some of the things I've been scared to hear (re: things he does when I'm around vs. when I'm not around.) Next week I shall try to _\"\"regulate\"\"_ again so I can also grant him some alone time. I must say I appreciate him so much recently — for the first time in months he came to UP again to visit me, and went to the dorm with me, too. He has been consistently inviting me to play Stardew Valley or watch Black Mirror. Not to mention he's been cooking for me (us) again (even wakes up early for it so I can eat early before class, too). Yesterday he told me \"he worries too\", asking me my whereabouts because it has been an hour then since I told him I was on my way home. My heart totally melted in the crummy Ministop chair; my ass totally assumed he just needed something again. \nHonestly, something tells me he asked for advice about this, but some part of me also completely doubts that; but who knows, maybe he has opened up to his bestfriend. I also cannot lie, too, that I expect another downtime after this, which is why a _\"\"regulation\"\"_ should always be in order.\n\nWell, what else. He wants to do a startup, and I guess I'll be a dev in it. Sounds really fun; I'd honestly go for it for free lol, all I'd need is time with him and I'm good. Sounds clingy as fuck but I'd take it in a heartbeat, damn. \nI really wish, though, that I was more preoccupied with what he has tasked me to do that frickin Stardew. But then again, he causes my distraction too because he constantly invites me to play with him. \n\nBut yeah, of course I haven't written anything down on here, but since June-July, it was almost every damn day that I would picture myself typing words on this damned text editor — a breakup letter. I've told my bestfriend multiple fucking times that I'd break up with him soon, next week, whatever. But it would never happen; of course I'd/we'd always feel \"okay\" towards him/each other on the day/s I've decided I'll finally break it off. It's not the first time this has happened. And so until now I haven't broken up with anyone yet, and still unacquainted with how it feels to be the one to break up with someone. Many times I saw in my head the breakup letter changing its words — its introduction specifically — about how it's supposedly a letter for breaking up with him but because things have looked up, I've decided against it. I'm still thinking whether I'll send him something. I probably should. Everyday always feel so casual and we don't really talk about our relationship, so, yeah. I guess I'll send him something some time soon. It should also help drive a conversation about how we'll go about with what we have. Man, I haven't introduced him to my parents yet. I already want to so bad, but I'm also thinking maybe grad would be a good time, too. I'm just really worried what they'll think about the stupid age gap, but other than that I'm not really worried about anything.\n\nAnyway, I think that's more than enough of an entry. I've gotten distracted while writing the previous paragraph and the drowsiness is also overtaking by now (1:43AM on my clock) so I guess I'm ending it here. I'm pretty satisfied with how this went; I'm glad I was able to write this damn wall of text. I thought it was going to be just another picture in my mind; a plan I'll never begin on.

Surprisingly, I had much energy throughout the day and didn't feel sleepy.\n\nGoing back. I want to talk about today and what has been happening recently.\n\nDay started off well. I woke up quite early, but still arrived late for class. It really sucks having had prepared early and not making it on time <!-- more --> still. It feels dumbing, to be honest. My workout went well, but felt dull. I wish I did better, but I decided to take it easy on some parts because it's been a week since my previous workout. I can't seem to build this sort of momentum so I can get better every meeting. Still no motivation to continue working out regularly so I can improve my weights. Sad.\n\nA usual routine after PE class is going back to the dorm; riding a pedicab on the way there (from the jeepney stop). As I reached my payment to the driver and hopped off the pedicab, I overheard the driver mumbling and sort of cursing. I was able to make out he was saying something about the amount I gave him: 6 pesos. I've always known the fare was six pesos - no one really hasn't said anything as I gave them my coins. Just recently, I was able to share a ride with a child whose mother asked how much it would cost the child, and the driver responded the same amount. I have no idea if I gave the wrong amount, or kuya was just having a bad day or something. I wish I could've asked, but I was already a distance away and at that time wasn't sure if I was hearing things right. At first it ticked me off that he didn't tell me properly if I *did* give him the wrong amount; mumbling to yourself and cursing your passenger is rude and doesn't really help with anything. But in any case, he has all the right to complain for such a scant amount he wasn't (probably) expecting. On my part, I just wish he told me properly. I wouldn't have hesitated to give him the amount he asks (given that it isn't overboard). This has been tugging at me at the back of my head, also getting paranoid that he has remembered where I live or what I look like and has ordered someone (or has plotted himself) to have me killed. Fuck. I really hope not.\n\nAh, I forgot to tell about my dream from last night/this morning.\nI dreamt about James, my ex. I dreamt that we met up, and from what it seems, he was still into me. He was quite clingy, and I have to admit it was a refreshing moment spending time with him again. (Looking back, though, he doesn't really act as clingy and affectionate in person.) In my dream, I was aware that I was currently in a relationship, and that what I was doing isn't harmful or wrong. We're merely meeting as friends anyway. James and I proceeded to sit on a bench in a mall, and for some reason he starts kissing my neck. I asked him to stop - I was uncomfortable because I *am* in a relationship, but he insisted on going. I was also hesitant because I know he's also in a relationship. So, I let it happen. And it was just weird. Because admittedly, I think I would have acted the same way if it happened in real life. My \"*true colors*\" showed in that dream for sure. *__God damn it runs in the blood.__* My cheating tendencies manifested in my dream, and it's not impossible to happen. \nAnyway, the next thing is that I fetch my current boyfriend (in my dream...and it's not Miah. Strange) who apparently works in a restaurant/food place in the mall where we were. He met me outside his workplace in tears, asking what do I think I'm doing -- implying he knows I've met up with my ex (maybe he saw what he was doing to me too, idk). He was tall, in a cook's outfit. I don't know who he is in real life. He seems to resemble James as well -- works in the kitchen and is taller than I am. The usual \"I can explain\" was exchanged but he refused to hear it. I don't remember what happened next but I think I turned conscious that Miah was out of the context, and wondered why. My memory can't recall any more other scenes except for me trying to text the boyfriend to apologize/explain, and his contact name on my phone was Charles. So I guess he's my former gig buddy, Charles. Idk.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWalked to PI 100 class and arrived to, well, no classes. Sucks. I was actually looking forward to learning something at PI class for once because I've missed so many meetings already. That was a bummer for me, not gonna lie.\n\nAfter Geol class, I decided to drop by the human rights ED today to refresh my memory (and add some stuff as well, I guess), and I arrived quite early at the place. Found a number of people in the room so early and doubted they were the applicants. Sucks, I don't even have that */command/* as a member to ask if they were applicants, jeez. Some of the members came in a few minutes after, and I couldn't feel more alone and *isolated* in a room of people, who also happen to be my orgmates. I felt so out of place -- a feeling so familiar, I don't think I will never stop experiencing it. It also feels like a slap on the face that I wasn't able to harness much meaningful friendships in college like I hoped to back in the day. It is my graduating year and I still only recognize one - *__one__* friend, in my entire college circle. \n\n*got distracted zzz*\n\nI criticized the pres of my other org anonymously. And some of the execomm seems to be taking it the wrong way lol sure, I really am starting to see the toxicity of the internals of the org as relayed to me, tbh. Straightforward is not being inconstructive. Please do take note of the things I said because I am simply relaying to you (anonymously) what the others can't say straight to your face (because they're not as assholey as you are)\n\n...\n\nAnyway, I lost the mood. Kinda just want to sleep at this point. Good night.","source":"_posts/unkind.md","raw":"---\ntitle: unkind\ndate: 2018-09-25 21:48:41\ntags:\n    - bullcrap\n    - drama\ncategories:\n    - life\n---\n\nHi. \nThis day didn't particularly go well for me, despite hopes of having it so.\nI was energized better last week (sans the part of me getting sick), specifically last Tuesday when we had this strenuous circuit workout for PE.

I can't seem to build this sort of momentum so I can get better every meeting. Still no motivation to continue working out regularly so I can improve my weights. Sad.\n\nA usual routine after PE class is going back to the dorm; riding a pedicab on the way there (from the jeepney stop). As I reached my payment to the driver and hopped off the pedicab, I overheard the driver mumbling and sort of cursing. I was able to make out he was saying something about the amount I gave him: 6 pesos. I've always known the fare was six pesos - no one really hasn't said anything as I gave them my coins. Just recently, I was able to share a ride with a child whose mother asked how much it would cost the child, and the driver responded the same amount. I have no idea if I gave the wrong amount, or kuya was just having a bad day or something. I wish I could've asked, but I was already a distance away and at that time wasn't sure if I was hearing things right. At first it ticked me off that he didn't tell me properly if I *did* give him the wrong amount; mumbling to yourself and cursing your passenger is rude and doesn't really help with anything. But in any case, he has all the right to complain for such a scant amount he wasn't (probably) expecting. On my part, I just wish he told me properly. I wouldn't have hesitated to give him the amount he asks (given that it isn't overboard). This has been tugging at me at the back of my head, also getting paranoid that he has remembered where I live or what I look like and has ordered someone (or has plotted himself) to have me killed. Fuck. I really hope not.\n\nAh, I forgot to tell about my dream from last night/this morning.\nI dreamt about James, my ex. I dreamt that we met up, and from what it seems, he was still into me. He was quite clingy, and I have to admit it was a refreshing moment spending time with him again. (Looking back, though, he doesn't really act as clingy and affectionate in person.) In my dream, I was aware that I was currently in a relationship, and that what I was doing isn't harmful or wrong. We're merely meeting as friends anyway. James and I proceeded to sit on a bench in a mall, and for some reason he starts kissing my neck. I asked him to stop - I was uncomfortable because I *am* in a relationship, but he insisted on going. I was also hesitant because I know he's also in a relationship. So, I let it happen. And it was just weird. Because admittedly, I think I would have acted the same way if it happened in real life. My \"*true colors*\" showed in that dream for sure. *__God damn it runs in the blood.__* My cheating tendencies manifested in my dream, and it's not impossible to happen. \nAnyway, the next thing is that I fetch my current boyfriend (in my dream...and it's not Miah. Strange) who apparently works in a restaurant/food place in the mall where we were. He met me outside his workplace in tears, asking what do I think I'm doing -- implying he knows I've met up with my ex (maybe he saw what he was doing to me too, idk). He was tall, in a cook's outfit. I don't know who he is in real life. He seems to resemble James as well -- works in the kitchen and is taller than I am. The usual \"I can explain\" was exchanged but he refused to hear it. I don't remember what happened next but I think I turned conscious that Miah was out of the context, and wondered why. My memory can't recall any more other scenes except for me trying to text the boyfriend to apologize/explain, and his contact name on my phone was Charles. So I guess he's my former gig buddy, Charles. Idk.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWalked to PI 100 class and arrived to, well, no classes. Sucks. I was actually looking forward to learning something at PI class for once because I've missed so many meetings already. That was a bummer for me, not gonna lie.\n\nAfter Geol class, I decided to drop by the human rights ED today to refresh my memory (and add some stuff as well, I guess), and I arrived quite early at the place. Found a number of people in the room so early and doubted they were the applicants. Sucks, I don't even have that */command/* as a member to ask if they were applicants, jeez. Some of the members came in a few minutes after, and I couldn't feel more alone and *isolated* in a room of people, who also happen to be my orgmates. I felt so out of place -- a feeling so familiar, I don't think I will never stop experiencing it. It also feels like a slap on the face that I wasn't able to harness much meaningful friendships in college like I hoped to back in the day. It is my graduating year and I still only recognize one - *__one__* friend, in my entire college circle. \n\n*got distracted zzz*\n\nI criticized the pres of my other org anonymously.

Fatal gunshot.\nI didn't think I'd be affected, but here I am, writing about it. Not to mention I even cried about it shortly after hearing the news.\n\nI'm still in shock and disbelief. We're not really friends anymore, but I suppose it's always shocking since we did share <!-- more --> something in the past anyway. Maybe that's how empathy works. Maybe I have a heart anyway. I just didn't expect that I'd be _this_ affected. It's a shock that he has to go this way.\n\nHaven't stopped thinking about it since this morning. I'm trying not to post/talk about it publicly because I don't feel like I have the right to. All the words I have in my head for him are cliché words people usually say when someone has died. \nHowever I'm not trying to say that they aren't genuine. It's just really sad and shocking.\n\nBut maybe if I keep talking about it, it'll lose its meaning and I wouldn't be as sad anymore.\n\nMaybe.\n\nI've only pictured in my head how things are going to roll on Saturday when I see his corpse, but let's see how that's gonna go.\nHopefully I don't sleep in. That would be such a shame.\nIf this is how I'm gonna see him for the last time, then, okay.\nI'd like to say goodbye, and thank you, and sorry.\n\n_I'm getting so emotional right now._\n\n---\n\nTo add to things, J*** has finally caught up with my lame responses from recent. Finally asking me if I'm alright.\n\nNo, sir, I haven't been alright. It's been a hellish three-something months.\n\nI just didn't think today -- and now -- of all times, would be the time this would be brought up. Thought it'd be delayed again for many fucking weeks/months because I'm a coward who can't find the timing and words to cut ties with people besides cutting them off completely without word. It's just easier that way.\nBut I suppose it's better that way, just happen as it should, no warnings, no nothing, guard completely down while at it. Of course things don't always go as planned.\n\nI was suppose to pastebin all this shit to him, but it turns out I am going to talk to him about it _today_. \n\nGee. Great timing.\n\nMy heart is just getting heavier and heavier as I continue typing.\n\nThe song playing in the background isn't helping either.\n\nBut, it's true. I haven't been well. And even though there are days when I'm relatively better, I'm not going to discount the days where I feel completely helpless about the same recurring thing/problem. The fact that it's still there, and has _always_ been there, means I shouldn't ignore it. I shouldn't keep just crying it out, feeling sad, just to feel the same thing in a couple more days.\n\nWith that, I've considered going to therapy. I am also in disbelief at the amount of tears I cried two nights ago, drunk. I cried so much. It was one hell of a breakdown. My eyes were swollen the next day (good thing my bangs covered them well enough during the day). I haven't cried so much like that in long, but it must've been all the emotions and words and whatnot that I've swept under the rug (as I always do).\n\n\nI don't want to make this any more emotional as it already is, but man... I could very well be losing two people today.\n\nI don't know what kind of bearing the _heavier_ loss has for the future for me, but the probable second one, well...\nI'd finally be free from the shackles holding me down for like half a month now. That fucking long, huh.\n\nI shall go face this storm now. If it even happens tonight, might as well as early as today.\n\n\n\n<small>_wait, when am i gonna lose you?_</small>\n","source":"_posts/when-am-i-gonna-lose-you.md","raw":"---\ntitle: when am i gonna lose you\ndate: 2020-01-23 16:18:24\ncategories:\n    - life\ntags:\n    - drama\n    - plans\n---\n\n<small>_**now playing:** when am i gonna lose you - local natives_\n<small>on repeat again for like the thousandth time just this week</small></small>\n\nThis day hasn't been as good as I would have wanted it to be.\n\nLearned this morning that my ex died a few days ago.

All the words I have in my head for him are cliché words people usually say when someone has died. \nHowever I'm not trying to say that they aren't genuine.

That would be such a shame.\nIf this is how I'm gonna see him for the last time, then, okay.\nI'd like to say goodbye, and thank you, and sorry.\n\n_I'm getting so emotional right now._\n\n---\n\nTo add to things, J*** has finally caught up with my lame responses from recent. Finally asking me if I'm alright.\n\nNo, sir, I haven't been alright. It's been a hellish three-something months.\n\nI just didn't think today -- and now -- of all times, would be the time this would be brought up. Thought it'd be delayed again for many fucking weeks/months because I'm a coward who can't find the timing and words to cut ties with people besides cutting them off completely without word. It's just easier that way.\nBut I suppose it's better that way, just happen as it should, no warnings, no nothing, guard completely down while at it. Of course things don't always go as planned.\n\nI was suppose to pastebin all this shit to him, but it turns out I am going to talk to him about it _today_. \n\nGee. Great timing.\n\nMy heart is just getting heavier and heavier as I continue typing.\n\nThe song playing in the background isn't helping either.\n\nBut, it's true. I haven't been well. And even though there are days when I'm relatively better, I'm not going to discount the days where I feel completely helpless about the same recurring thing/problem. The fact that it's still there, and has _always_ been there, means I shouldn't ignore it. I shouldn't keep just crying it out, feeling sad, just to feel the same thing in a couple more days.\n\nWith that, I've considered going to therapy. I am also in disbelief at the amount of tears I cried two nights ago, drunk. I cried so much. It was one hell of a breakdown. My eyes were swollen the next day (good thing my bangs covered them well enough during the day). I haven't cried so much like that in long, but it must've been all the emotions and words and whatnot that I've swept under the rug (as I always do).\n\n\nI don't want to make this any more emotional as it already is, but man... I could very well be losing two people today.\n\nI don't know what kind of bearing the _heavier_ loss has for the future for me, but the probable second one, well...\nI'd finally be free from the shackles holding me down for like half a month now. That fucking long, huh.\n\nI shall go face this storm now.
