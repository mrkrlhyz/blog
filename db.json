I'm part of a startup now.\n\nWell, it's my boyfriend's startup. Not sure if it was made on a whim (probably not, probably yeah), but it was an abrupt and sudden event being part of it.\nIt was like, hey, you're part of a mini company now, whose product you will know as we go.\n\nYeah, I know right.\n\nIt was all sudden. I've always wanted to work on a startup, but not at this point where I <!-- more --> wanted to focus most on my thesis. I lose everything if I fail this. I need to graduate within the year. The pressure is intense and a startup is not what I need at this point; but here I am anyway. I would say I was *forced* into this, but hey, I agreed.

And now I am. \n\nIt's just that the worktime is rapid and pressured because of Startup School. It's a ten-week program and I believe we have to catch up to something (just learned this today, jeezus) else we get removed from the group or something. Crazy. He's the only one working on the startup full-time. I would really recommend him getting another someone else to work with him (but who knows if he's already done that.) \n\nLike previously mentioned, this was all so abrupt; unexpected. I still haven't find my place in the startup and can't seem to claim it as my own yet as of now. I always refer to it as *__his__ startup* even though I'm technically a part of it. Haven't talked to the other guy as well so I'm honestly not feeling it. Because of the overwhelming events recently academics-wise, I guess it hasn't fully sunk in with me. I get it, but I'm *just not feeling it.*\n\nSo tonight was the first meeting with the rest of our groupmates. We have just gotten home from the infirmary (and dinner) so overall we weren't exactly prepared to talk about with people. Man, I was just mum the entire thing. (Although I broke the ice for a bit when we logged on) But god, that was fucking stressful for me. I really could see how he was shaking beside me, clearly unprepared for the chat. And because I haven't claimed it as one of mine yet, I couldn't seem to form a complete thought that would totally rebut what the other guys were saying against our product. I get that it's criticism and probably inquiry to further understand what we want to put out there, but I honestly felt it was all plain attacking. Maybe because I'm such a fucking baby who can't take criticism (a hypocrite), but maybe also because there *is* some sort of elimination of teams on the second week. Like what I said to Daya, I expected the entire thing to be a sort of competition with everyone, but the forums proved me otherwise. I didn't feel like the criticism sounded *supportive* as in to like try to improve or try to let us explain further what our product was, but rather they were all very *_shutting down_* kind of words to me. It was just stressing me out the entire time (fan was off even and I was **_s w e a t i n g_**) and afterwards I'm just the stare-y me, wondering what I could've done differently. I could've cut them off any time, coming to his rescue (that I'm sure he doesn't need) and defending what we have. While I partly agree with their opinions, of course I'm full-on siding with my team duh. However, I have to say I was thankful that this other guy (who was Pinoy also) was sorta seeing how actually good (or at least that's how it came to me) of a \"novelty\" (his words) our product would become if it did rise up. So, thank you, cool guy, for being the supportive one in the group, and saying things I would have said (not your exact words, but the intention, I guess). There definitely were some words forming in my head but the stress was just clouding my train of thought that I'm sure I would just stutter on cam in front of all these grown men (and women) who, in my opinion, are just trying to race and take each other down.\n\nMaybe that's just cynical me, but who knows. As much as their (initial) words and greetings are all friendly-*sounding*, I'm sure it's all for show and is just plain formality. After all, you keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. And well, you smile a lot to them too, of course.\n\n*Ew, how distrustful are you, you piece of shit?*\n","source":"_posts/a-bit-shaken.md","raw":"---\ntitle: a bit shaken\ndate: 2018-09-03 23:40:36\ntags:\n    - mild bullcrap\ncategories:\n    - [life]\n    - [dev]\n---\n\nI don't think I've said anything on this blog yet since it's fairly recent news but, yeah.

I just think I should get this done so I can feel at least productive. __Hey, self. Feel free to update this in the future, maybe.__*\n\nAt one point in your life, did you ever hate me?\n\nWere you glad to have met me? Of all the people you meet and keep almost every day of your life, am I one you'd save if you could only choose a few?\n\n~~Why am I writing this again?~~\n\nI've been wondering how we drifted apart. You got busy and just kind <!-- more --> of stopped replying to my messages. Which I totally understood, but it was difficult to have gotten _ghosted_ just like that back then. You just disappeared, man. I've learned to not give a fuck anymore and just get going, move on that maybe I wasn't any more special than the people you've gotten to meet after me. That, maybe, just like with that night, we could just pretend that nothing happened and that we were never really close friends or whatever. I mean, that's how it is in the ~~hallways~~, right? Right. _I've learned to act as if it's normal to ignore people you have shared moments with._ \n\nIn any case, I wouldn't say I'm bitter but it's just that, I think from that point on I've started to question if people ever gave a flying shit about me.

Next week I shall try to _\"\"regulate\"\"_ again so I can also grant him some alone time. I must say I appreciate him so much recently — for the first time in months he came to UP again to visit me, and went to the dorm with me, too. He has been consistently inviting me to play Stardew Valley or watch Black Mirror. Not to mention he's been cooking for me (us) again (even wakes up early for it so I can eat early before class, too). Yesterday he told me \"he worries too\", asking me my whereabouts because it has been an hour then since I told him I was on my way home. My heart totally melted in the crummy Ministop chair; my ass totally assumed he just needed something again. \nHonestly, something tells me he asked for advice about this, but some part of me also completely doubts that; but who knows, maybe he has opened up to his bestfriend. I also cannot lie, too, that I expect another downtime after this, which is why a _\"\"regulation\"\"_ should always be in order.\n\nWell, what else. He wants to do a startup, and I guess I'll be a dev in it. Sounds really fun; I'd honestly go for it for free lol, all I'd need is time with him and I'm good. Sounds clingy as fuck but I'd take it in a heartbeat, damn. \nI really wish, though, that I was more preoccupied with what he has tasked me to do that frickin Stardew. But then again, he causes my distraction too because he constantly invites me to play with him. \n\nBut yeah, of course I haven't written anything down on here, but since June-July, it was almost every damn day that I would picture myself typing words on this damned text editor — a breakup letter. I've told my bestfriend multiple fucking times that I'd break up with him soon, next week, whatever. But it would never happen; of course I'd/we'd always feel \"okay\" towards him/each other on the day/s I've decided I'll finally break it off. It's not the first time this has happened. And so until now I haven't broken up with anyone yet, and still unacquainted with how it feels to be the one to break up with someone.

Surprisingly, I had much energy throughout the day and didn't feel sleepy.\n\nGoing back. I want to talk about today and what has been happening recently.\n\nDay started off well. I woke up quite early, but still arrived late for class. It really sucks having had prepared early and not making it on time <!-- more --> still. It feels dumbing, to be honest. My workout went well, but felt dull. I wish I did better, but I decided to take it easy on some parts because it's been a week since my previous workout. I can't seem to build this sort of momentum so I can get better every meeting. Still no motivation to continue working out regularly so I can improve my weights. Sad.\n\nA usual routine after PE class is going back to the dorm; riding a pedicab on the way there (from the jeepney stop). As I reached my payment to the driver and hopped off the pedicab, I overheard the driver mumbling and sort of cursing.

I wouldn't have hesitated to give him the amount he asks (given that it isn't overboard).

In my dream, I was aware that I was currently in a relationship, and that what I was doing isn't harmful or wrong. We're merely meeting as friends anyway. James and I proceeded to sit on a bench in a mall, and for some reason he starts kissing my neck. I asked him to stop - I was uncomfortable because I *am* in a relationship, but he insisted on going. I was also hesitant because I know he's also in a relationship. So, I let it happen. And it was just weird. Because admittedly, I think I would have acted the same way if it happened in real life. My \"*true colors*\" showed in that dream for sure. *__God damn it runs in the blood.__* My cheating tendencies manifested in my dream, and it's not impossible to happen. \nAnyway, the next thing is that I fetch my current boyfriend (in my dream...and it's not Miah.

Some of the members came in a few minutes after, and I couldn't feel more alone and *isolated* in a room of people, who also happen to be my orgmates. I felt so out of place -- a feeling so familiar, I don't think I will never stop experiencing it.
