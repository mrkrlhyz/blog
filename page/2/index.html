        <p> <p>While I am still under the influence of endorphins brought about by working out, and listening to Billie Eilish, let me try to write something without getting distracted.</p>
<p>Life has been stagnant. I feel immensely unproductive in my academics; I have more complaints than progress. But just quite recently, I’ve been able to catch up on an aspect of my life that I thought I’ve left behind for good.</p>
<p><em>Socializing.</em></p>
<p><del>got distracted trying to search how to create your own text editors sksksksks</del></p>
<p>It may have started from <del>frat leaks issue</del> me visiting the MC tambs just so I could pay some due fees (yes, I’m not as trashy as you think I am), when around 5 applicants swarmed towards me to interview me and get my sig. I thought that was pretty cool, and I actually missed doing things like that. It actually prompted me to stay for a bit just to hang out, maybe some more apps will come in and I can get to talk to them. :) (I may have blabbered way too much with this one app though because one of her first impressions of me was ‘madaldal’ :/ welp) I guess talking to people can be nice sometimes (especially if they seem to like you and they laugh at your dumb jokes.) It reminded me of how I used to be this lost, lonely, shy, and friendless freshman in my first semester in college, and any person (other than my roommates) offering a few seconds of their precious time to talk to me would make my day. How absolutely pathetic, but that’s how it was.<br>Nowadays, sometimes I find myself getting carried away when I talk to people – it seems that I also miss having conversations with people other than my bestfriend slash only friend in the department. And again, plus points if I do make them laugh when I try to squeeze in some lame jokes. </p>
<p><del>got distracted on reddit ZZZZZZZZZZZ</del></p>
<p>Going back.<br>Following the recent event on this infamous evil toxic frat in the university, I have been quite actively communicating with my other org again. We all transferred to a different communication platform because of security reasons, and for some reason I <del>haven’t</del> (update: have) muted them yet. </p>
<p>5:20 PM 11/25/2018</p>
<p>Wow hello distraction. I’m continuing this post while I’m burning time (and getting my food digested) in this shithole “cafe” I ended up in. </p>
<p><em>Going back.</em></p>
<p>There has been, undoubtedly, a thirst to socialize. It hasn’t been the same as before when I’d suck up the loneliness and mope in my lameass fetal position. Recently, there has been active searching for interaction. </p>

        <p> <p>Hi. Long time no post.</p>
<p>Just wanted to put this out here: <a href="https://screenshots.firefox.com/BCX7hDz7NaIYTKvT/msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://screenshots.firefox.com/BCX7hDz7NaIYTKvT/msu.edu</a><br>It’s a screenshot of mine of a website where this poem called The Hollow Men is written, and I just maybe sort of fell in love with the site layout.<br>I’m kind of driven to design my next theme after this one. Hngh, forgive my lack of creative juices. I’ll try to sketch something a bit different than this. &gt;_&lt;<br>The past few weeks have been nice to me, btw. Okay, bye.</p>
