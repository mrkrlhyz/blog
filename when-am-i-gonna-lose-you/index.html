        <p><p><small><em><strong>now playing:</strong> when am i gonna lose you - local natives</em><br><small>on repeat again for like the thousandth time just this week</small></small></p>
<p>This day hasn’t been as good as I would have wanted it to be.</p>
<p>Learned this morning that my ex died a few days ago. Fatal gunshot.<br>I didn’t think I’d be affected, but here I am, writing about it. Not to mention I even cried about it shortly after hearing the news.</p>
<p>I’m still in shock and disbelief. We’re not really friends anymore, but I suppose it’s always shocking since we did share <a id="more"></a> something in the past anyway. Maybe that’s how empathy works. Maybe I have a heart anyway. I just didn’t expect that I’d be <em>this</em> affected. It’s a shock that he has to go this way.</p>
<p>Haven’t stopped thinking about it since this morning. I’m trying not to post/talk about it publicly because I don’t feel like I have the right to. All the words I have in my head for him are cliché words people usually say when someone has died.<br>However I’m not trying to say that they aren’t genuine. It’s just really sad and shocking.</p>
<p>But maybe if I keep talking about it, it’ll lose its meaning and I wouldn’t be as sad anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I’ve only pictured in my head how things are going to roll on Saturday when I see his corpse, but let’s see how that’s gonna go.<br>Hopefully I don’t sleep in. That would be such a shame.<br>If this is how I’m gonna see him for the last time, then, okay.<br>I’d like to say goodbye, and thank you, and sorry.</p>
<p><em>I’m getting so emotional right now.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>To add to things, J*** has finally caught up with my lame responses from recent. Finally asking me if I’m alright.</p>
<p>No, sir, I haven’t been alright. It’s been a hellish three-something months.</p>
<p>I just didn’t think today – and now – of all times, would be the time this would be brought up. Thought it’d be delayed again for many fucking weeks/months because I’m a coward who can’t find the timing and words to cut ties with people besides cutting them off completely without word. It’s just easier that way.<br>But I suppose it’s better that way, just happen as it should, no warnings, no nothing, guard completely down while at it. Of course things don’t always go as planned.</p>
<p>I was suppose to pastebin all this shit to him, but it turns out I am going to talk to him about it <em>today</em>. </p>
<p>Gee. Great timing.</p>
<p>My heart is just getting heavier and heavier as I continue typing.</p>
<p>The song playing in the background isn’t helping either.</p>
<p>But, it’s true. I haven’t been well. And even though there are days when I’m relatively better, I’m not going to discount the days where I feel completely helpless about the same recurring thing/problem. The fact that it’s still there, and has <em>always</em> been there, means I shouldn’t ignore it. I shouldn’t keep just crying it out, feeling sad, just to feel the same thing in a couple more days.</p>
<p>With that, I’ve considered going to therapy. I am also in disbelief at the amount of tears I cried two nights ago, drunk. I cried so much. It was one hell of a breakdown. My eyes were swollen the next day (good thing my bangs covered them well enough during the day). I haven’t cried so much like that in long, but it must’ve been all the emotions and words and whatnot that I’ve swept under the rug (as I always do).</p>
<p>I don’t want to make this any more emotional as it already is, but man… I could very well be losing two people today.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of bearing the <em>heavier</em> loss has for the future for me, but the probable second one, well…<br>I’d finally be free from the shackles holding me down for like half a month now. That fucking long, huh.</p>
<p>I shall go face this storm now. If it even happens tonight, might as well as early as today.</p>
<p><small><em>wait, when am i gonna lose you?</em></small></p>
