        <p><p><em>Writing this with a sleepy mind. I just think I should get this done so I can feel at least productive. <strong>Hey, self. Feel free to update this in the future, maybe.</strong></em></p>
<p>At one point in your life, did you ever hate me?</p>
<p>Were you glad to have met me? Of all the people you meet and keep almost every day of your life, am I one you’d save if you could only choose a few?</p>
<p><del>Why am I writing this again?</del></p>
<p>I’ve been wondering how we drifted apart. You got busy and just kind <a id="more"></a> of stopped replying to my messages. Which I totally understood, but it was difficult to have gotten <em>ghosted</em> just like that back then. You just disappeared, man. I’ve learned to not give a fuck anymore and just get going, move on that maybe I wasn’t any more special than the people you’ve gotten to meet after me. That, maybe, just like with that night, we could just pretend that nothing happened and that we were never really close friends or whatever. I mean, that’s how it is in the <del>hallways</del>, right? Right. <em>I’ve learned to act as if it’s normal to ignore people you have shared moments with.</em> </p>
<p>In any case, I wouldn’t say I’m bitter but it’s just that, I think from that point on I’ve started to question if people ever gave a flying shit about me. Or am I just really for a good time, until it gets old? Cause man, you made it seem so easy to go from 100 to zero. From daily chitchat to six-month (inapproximate) downtime (with ignored–some, otherwise–messages in between).</p>
<p>The thing is, it just happened to cross my mind that during all this time you decided to disappear in my life like motherfucking <strong><em>nothing</em></strong>, you were entertaining someone, willingly opening yourself to this person, possibly freeing up and offering your time, sacrificing work. Who knows. <del>So it’s something like, when one door closes, another one opens.</del> Hey, I’m honestly glad you’ve finally found someone to share <em>something</em> with; I still recall how you talk about wishing to finally find someone. I have no fucking idea why you didn’t just look <em>around</em> but hey, it’s cool. I didn’t particularly want to ever reject you, plus, I think we’ve talked about this. But of course you probably don’t remember. </p>
<p>Jeez, this post sounds so damn bitter and jealous…but, for the record, I’m not. It’s just that sometimes, you still surprise me. Like, who’d think that, after all this goddamn time, you still have an inch of care in your heart for me? Or is that just basic decency? <em>Hey, we used to be friends and do fun stuff. Ionno. I guess.</em> And, if I have to be honest, I still thinking about the stuff we used to do. Not even the <em>frisky</em> ones. Just…anything. But hey, thank you for taking about 2 hours of your day to just sit down and have a chat with me. I don’t even remember if I told you but I woke up early for that shit. And I didn’t mind not getting enough sleep despite having a <em>long rough night</em>. *clears throat*</p>
<p>Sleepy mind, sleepy mind. I’ll let you speak all the riddles for me.</p>
<p><em><del>should probably do this more often</del></em></p>
