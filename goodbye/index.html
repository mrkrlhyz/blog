        <p><p>Semantic satiation - a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds.<br>I thought repeatedly talking and thinking about the news of your death would somehow lose its meaning and dampen the brunt of impact on me, but I suppose that doesn’t work if you’re just purposefully drowning your emotions in denial. It all dawned on me after almost 3 hours of travel to come see you. It was all real, right in front of me.</p>
<p>James, the last time we saw each other was around the same time two years ago, January 2018. I would have never thought that the next time I would see you you’d be in your best suit, lying lifeless in a casket. You had to be taken away in the most brutal, violent way possible. There’s just no acceptable reason for you to go this way. You were powerless. You didn’t deserve this.</p>
<p>I only learned the news two days after the incident. I unexpectedly couldn’t hold my tears that day. I cried on my bed, on the keyboard, on the dishes, into my pillows, and I’m still crying as I write this. I was in shock, but I was also confused. We haven’t really been talking, only greeting each other during birthdays now, and essentially have been more or less estranged… but why was I so deeply affected? I’ve been trying to justify why this hurts like hell. After transporting myself back to three years ago, I found my answers.</p>
<p>You were my first boyfriend. You were the first guy I introduced to my parents. You were my first Valentine. You were my best friend for almost a good year, and we went through a lot. Your friends became mine, and mine yours. We instantly clicked on the first conversation on Tinder and there just wasn’t any time to be just friends. I’ll never forget the night we first met. We slow danced to Lakambini by Ebe Dancel in UP Fair during Valentines Day, the night I agreed to be yours. There was a hell lot of good times and adventures with you. All these years of estrangement couldn’t possibly erase these facts. I have been looking at our photos and reading our old conversations since Thursday. I wore the socks you gave me yesterday, and your shirt to sleep last night. I still have the playlists we made for each other and they will always be here. Only now it’s just going to hurt more to listen to them because you’re gone for good. You are gone forever. In the words that your mother told me, “Wala na siya. Wala na [ang] first boyfriend mo.”</p>
<p>I touched a casket for the first time yesterday as I looked at you and said goodbye for the very last time. It was so hard, even more seeing your wounded face. I never thought I would lose anybody this way. It’s going to take me some time to navigate through this grief, but I hope the memories of your goodness will help me find my way. I’ll never forget you.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that your family finds justice, and most importantly, healing and peace. We live in such a cruel world, but you were undoubtedly one of the good ones on this earth. I wish you find peace wherever you are, James. I’m sorry and thank you for everything. I miss you dearly.</p>
<p>You’re Gonna Live Forever in Me - John Mayer.</p>
